'''
NumPy arrays have an attribute called shape that returns a 
tuple with each index having the number of corresponding elements.
'''

import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])
print(arr.shape)

'''
The example above returns (2, 4), which means that the array has 2 dimensions, 
where the first dimension has 2 elements and the second has 4.
